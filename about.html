					<h1>hi there!</h1>
					<br>
					<p>My name is Noelle Bergan and I have been doing yoga since I was 14. I was initially introduced to the practice through a class in highschool. At 19 I got into yoga more seriously and decided to do my YTT. I was certified in 2015 in a heated vinyasa hatha blended style. I continued to teach this style along with yin for 6 years and had the pleasure of moving to Utah and Australia doing so.
					</p>
					<p>In 2020 I had the opportunity to begin teaching vinyasa more regularly and creating my own sequences which helped me grow so much as a teacher. In 2021 I began an 800hr advance yoga therapy diploma which I am happy to say I've completed and feel so much more confident on the mat and instructing classes. Yoga has changed my life in countless ways. It has opened my eyes to parts of myself and the world that I didnt know existed. These realizations are the reason I feel so passionate about sharing yoga and helping others explore their minds bodies and the way they interact with the world around them.
